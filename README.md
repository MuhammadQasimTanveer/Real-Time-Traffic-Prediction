📖 Project Overview

        This project focuses on predicting real-time traffic using advanced Neural Network models to 
        reduce congestion, improve road safety, and optimize traffic flow in smart cities. It leverages 
        AI and deep learning techniques like CNNs, LSTMs, and hybrid models for accurate forecasting 
        based on historical, climatic, 

🎯 Objectives

        Develop a neural network-based model for traffic prediction
        Analyze essential data types (past traffic, weather, events, GPS) to enhance prediction accuracy
        Support real-time traffic management and navigation tools

🔍 Model Types:

        FNN (Feedforward Neural Network) for quick predictions
        RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) for hourly traffic trends
        LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) for long-term sequence data
        CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) for spatial data analysis
        Hybrid Models: Combining CNNs and LSTMs to capture both spatial and temporal traffic features, improving accuracy.
