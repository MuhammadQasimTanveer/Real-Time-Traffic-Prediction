This repository explores the application of neural networks for real-time traffic prediction using a multivariate approach. 
By integrating multiple factors—such as historical traffic data, weather conditions, time of day, and road incidents—our 
models aim to provide highly accurate and dynamic traffic forecasting.

This project is ideal for researchers, city planners, and AI developers working on intelligent transportation systems.
